# Basyc-Memory
Experiment 2

This first version of the game has an increasing pattern length that goes to 16.
Once the user has completed the pattern, the pattern will increase in length by one and the user will try again.
This process will repeat until the user loses or correctly inputs the 16 number long pattern.
