# Basyc-Memory

status: complete

Basyc Memory is a pattern-based memory game.
The game is played by observing an increasing pattern length that goes to 16 and then reciting it.
The pattern is displayed using bars on the side of the seven segment display corresponding to button position.
Once the user has completed the pattern, the pattern will increase in length by one and the user will try again.
This process will repeat until the user loses or correctly inputs the final pattern of length 16.
