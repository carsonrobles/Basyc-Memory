Experiment 2

This version of the game has an increasing pattern length that goes to 16.
Also, rather than displaying numbers this version displays bars on the side of the display corresponding to button position.
Once the user has completed the pattern, the pattern will increase in length by one and the user will try again.
This process will repeat until the user loses or correctly inputs the final pattern of length 16.
